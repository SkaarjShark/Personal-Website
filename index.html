                    <h2>I am a graduate from Bloomtech, which is a online school that not only teaches you how the web works, but also how to learn. They went in depth on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. They also taught me a lot about back-end development, API calls, and data handling and security. The most important thing they have taught me is with hard work and dedication, you can do so many things you thought you could never do before.</h2>
